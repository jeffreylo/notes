### 1:1s

1:1s are essential for:

1. building human connection and understanding
2. speaking privately on what’s important to discuss

1:1s should be regular. They are not status meetings of regular
projects. 1:1s should have an agenda. That agenda should be shared and
defined before the 1:1s. Don’t be late for 1:1s. Respect the time you
have together — build each other up in your respective roles.

### What you should expect

Your manager should:

- **provide regular feedback**, especially for areas of improvement. The
  formal performance review should not contain any surprises if feedback
  is delivered quickly, regularly, and directly. “Public praise, private
  criticism”. Public praise reinforces team culture and values; if you
  aren’t comfortable with public praise, say so.
- **provide technical feedback**. Engineering management is a technical
  job. You can expect and ask for participation from your manager on
  things you are presenting or writing.
- **provide career development**. If you want a promotion, your manager will
  work with you to get there. If you are struggling with a coworker,
  your manager should resolve these struggles between the both of you
  **with your participation**. If you aren’t stretched, your manager
  will work with you to find things that stretch and grow you.
- **provide guidance for the promotion track**. We will work together to
  put that packet together when you are ready for the next level. Your
  manager will set expectations on whether you are qualified. You
  should ask for feedback on specific areas in order to get that
  promotion.
- connect your day-to-day with how it impacts the company.
- make resources and opportunities for training and development known
  to you.

Expect feedback to change as you grow in seniority. There will be less
feedback for you directly on a personal level. There will be more team
and strategy input. As you grow in seniority, your manager will also
expect that you drive the 1:1s.

Seniority is a pyramid. As you grow, there will be fewer opportunities
available.

### “Being Managed”

Think about what you want, what you want out of this job, what you
want to learn, what makes you happy. You are responsible for your
yourself.

Your manager expect you to be clear about what you expect and how you
are feeling. Your manager can’t read your mind.

Your manager don’t expect you to work weekends, even if your manager
does. There will be ebbs and flows in what the job demands — there
will be times where you may have to work more. Everyone has different
appetites; your manager should focus on output, not hours.

You are responsible for yourself. This isn’t a cop-out, e.g., “if I’m
doing my job, I’m doing nothing”, but more you are responsible for
everything in your control, which includes, in part, managing what
your manager can do for you.

Your manager’s responsibility is to the team and the company — it is
not always about making you happy or satisfying your every request.

Evaluate your manager like you would a job. You are spending a
majority of your day at this company, with this team, and with your
manager. If you don’t feel like it’s a good fit, figure out why and
what might need to change.

Senior employees should focus on delivering solutions, not simply
raising problems. Be proactive.

Strong managers:

- play the game well. Companies are collections of people in different
  roles with individual incentives. Strong managers win by aligning
  these incentives.
- advocate for you. They get you attention and feedback from the
  people that matter to make an impact on your development and your
  compensation.
- have strong networks. They can connect you to new opportunities,
  even if you don’t work for them anymore.

Consider that great engineers can be ineffective managers because they
don’t know or don’t want to deal with politics. A great engineer can
be a good mentor, but may not advocate for you.

### Questions to consider

- Have you had a manager you considered good? What did this manager do
  that you found valuable?
- How often do you meet 1-1 with your manager? Do you come to 1-1s
  with your manager bringing topics to discuss? If your 1-1 is a
  status meeting, can you use some other means to convey that status?
- Do you feel that you can tell your manager when you have a major
  life event? Do you feel that your manager knows something about you
  personally?
- Has your manager delivered good feedback to you? Bad feedback? Any
  feedback at all?
- Has your manager helped you set any work-related goals for this
  year?
